# RoboMadness
This was a game made for my grade 11 computer science final.
I made this with my partner Perry. https://github.com/Blindman404

# To run
I have been getting issues with opening this project in vscode so I would recommend using eclipse to import the project into
Once you import the game. You will be able to run the game.java file and the game should come up.
If you have played a tower defense game before then you should be fine, if not do not worry as there are instructions on how to play in the game.
