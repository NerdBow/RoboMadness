# ICS3U-Game
This is a game that me and Perry are working on
It will be a tower defense game similar to arknights

Maps:
To make a map you want to make a new txt document
Next map out your map.
0: Enemy Path
1: Tower Placement
2: Nothing
3: Base
4: Enemy Spawn


Enemy Spawning:
To make a timing file you want to make a new txt document
Next time out your enemies
- The first line of the docuemnt shound be the number of enemies you will have in the map
- The lines under will be all the enemies you want to spawn
- Make a new line for each new enemy you wish to spawn
- The first number through 0-4 dictate which enemy you wish to spawn
- The number after that will the amount of seconds into the map you want the enemy to spawn
- Ex 010 (I will spawn enemy type 0 10 seconds into the map)
